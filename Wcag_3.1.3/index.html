          trends and developments. It's a dog-eat-dog world out there, so you
          need to think outside the box and push the envelope to stand out from
          the crowd.

          the same hymn sheet as your colleagues. Don't throw in the towel when
          faced with challenges; instead, roll up your sleeves and give it your
          best shot.

          the ground to stay ahead of the game. Don't let yourself get bogged
          down in the nitty-gritty; instead, focus on the big picture and think
          outside the box.
